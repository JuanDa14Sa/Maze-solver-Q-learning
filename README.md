# Maze Game RL Agent

The Maze Game RL Agent is a Python implementation of a reinforcement learning agent that learns to navigate a maze environment. The agent utilizes the Q-learning algorithm to learn the optimal actions to take in order to reach the goal while avoiding obstacles.

The game is built using the Pygame library, providing a visual representation of the maze and agent's movement. The agent learns from its interactions with the environment, updating its Q-values based on rewards received for each action. Through repeated episodes of gameplay, the agent improves its performance and learns to navigate the maze more efficiently.

The project allows for customization of various parameters such as maze size, maximum moves per episode, and the number of episodes for training. The maze structure itself can be modified by adjusting the grid representation in the code.
